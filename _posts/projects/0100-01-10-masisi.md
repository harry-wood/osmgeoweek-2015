MSF teams, in collaboration with the Congolese Ministry of Health, provide care for thousands of people in Masisi General Hospital and other health centres in the area, including the provision of HIV care. MSF also organises mobile clinics, which respond to the needs of people affected by violence, insecurity and poor access to healthcare, some of whom have have been forced to flee their homes.

Mapping this area will help MSF to identify vulnerable populations, plan and manage medical interventions and provide better care for those displaced by violence.

The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.
