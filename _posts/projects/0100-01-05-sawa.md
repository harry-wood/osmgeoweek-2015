The Bed Net Surveillance Program is a Peace Corps Madagascar initiative. The goal of the program is to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality in participating communities by encouraging community members to regularly use mosquito nets. The Bed Net Surveillance Program will monitor LLIN (Long Lasting Insecticide-treated Nets) usage through the help of GIS (Geographic Information System) based technologies. Community leaders will focus sensitization efforts on households that do not routinely sleep under mosquito nets in order to achieve high bednet coverage rates.
