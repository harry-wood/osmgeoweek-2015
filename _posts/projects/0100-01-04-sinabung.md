Sinabung is an active stratovolcano that has had consistent activity since 2010. The volcano poses a significant risk to those living in close proximity. Recent activity includes eruptions in 2010, 2013, 2014. The latest eruption occurred May 2016, killing 7 Indonesians.

For this task, the focus will be on two cities east of the volcano: Berastagi and Kabanjahe.

Volunteers will create and improve existing infrastructure data, with a focus on tracing buildings, roads, and inland water features.
