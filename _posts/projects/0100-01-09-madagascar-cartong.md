Madagascar is one of the poorest country in the world with more than 92% of the population living with less than $2 a day (WorldBank,2013). Also one of the most vulnerable country regarding the global warming (behind Haiti and Bangladesh), Madagascar gather climatic imbalances. Diana region in the North of the island particularly suffers from storms intensification, and disappearance of mangrove, which is natural barrier against storms and cyclona. Having a better and global understanding of the location of the population and its accessibility is crucial for NGOs and local actor to prepare risk reduction programs.
