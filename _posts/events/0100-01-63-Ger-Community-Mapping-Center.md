We’re holding a mapathon! We’re working with the Ger Community Mapping Center from Mongolia to map areas in need in Ulanbaatar. 
This work will assist local groups in Mongolia and enable communities to work for better resources and to address environmental 
and social concerns. It’s a great opportunity for you to learn about collaborative mapping with OpenStreetMap and help out!
