This event will have two sessions running at the same time:
Session 1 (Seminars) will focus on applications of GIS and illustrate use cases for humanitarian assistance, 
academic research and government decision-making, specifically marine spatial planning in Northern Ireland. 

Session 2 (Mapathon) is a mapathon in support of The Missing Maps Project and will begin after a presentation on the topic.
Interested participants will be directed to the Geography computer suite where they can make real contributions to this 
worthwhile humanitarian cause.

All participants will have the opportunity to change sessions in between speakers, should they choose to do so.
