We are hosting GIS Day on November 16th at Clemson University. 
It features amazing presentations from faculty and GIS professionals across the region. We have a scavenger hunt, 
where in the world contest, internship and job opportunities with Esri and NASA, cake, and a mapathon 
with pizza and donuts during lunch! The Mapathon is going to be from 12-1pm and a prize will be given to 
the student who maps the most features for the task available that day.
