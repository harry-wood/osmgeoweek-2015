The Medsin National Conference this year will be focussing on how we can improve the health of those 
people who are affected by the refugee and poverty crises. Expect inspiring speakers from around the 
world who will share with you their experiences, from working in conflict zones to new ways of working 
with vulnerable groups here in Glasgow to bring about improvements in health. We hope that you will leave 
the conference not only inspired, but able to create change.

It includes a Missing Mals workshop on the Sunday, in addition to another MSF related workshop by Freda 
Newlands on her experience of working out in Jordan as an emergency medicine doctor for MSF last year. 
All this in addition to an extensive and varied timetable!
