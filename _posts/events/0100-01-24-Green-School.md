A Missing Maps party to support the newly launched Map for Environment platform, 
funded by the World Resource Institute. The aim of the event is to map and capture 
the location and extent of deforestation in OpenStreetMap for areas in Indonesia. 
This stunning archipelago has the world's 3rd largest tropical rainforest, but is 
sadly ranked 2nd for deforestation. Half of Sumatra's forest cover disappeared from 1985 to 2008, 
and 90% of oil plantation in Kalimantan from 1990-2010 came at the expense of forest cover. 
This project was initiated by the devastating 2015 fires in Kalimantan that were linked to deforestation, 
and the desire of the Green School students in Bali to assist their neighbours.
