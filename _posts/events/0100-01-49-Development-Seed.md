Development Seed, along with other organizations contributing to OpenStreetMap, will host a Mapathon to raise awareness for GeoWeek and to engage the local DC community. There will be a brief introduction to mapping by the Red Cross, followed by presentations by Development Seed and Mapgive on their current contributions to the OSM community, after which mapping will begin!
