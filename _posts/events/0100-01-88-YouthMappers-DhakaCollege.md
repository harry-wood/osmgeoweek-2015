Hello Mappers, the day is upon us, almost. Its the day 16th november 2016. 
Get your mapping pants ready if there is such a thing, prepare your laptop, smartphones 
(this sounds dumb, does not it, smartphones). If you still have not registered yourself, 
do that first. We are going to do some mapping, map swiping, go through some basics of the 
mapping, train the newbies and we are going to have fun. So gear up.

Remember: Bring your mouse if you are bringing your laptop. Oh, and do bring yourself. 
Let's not forget that part.
