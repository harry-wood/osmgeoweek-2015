Kathmandu Living Labs has been working the past year in Pokhara to create OpenStreetMap data and active community to maintain the data. 
The work has been carried out with support from American Association of Geographer and in partnership with local government, 
volunteer agencies in Pokhara, educational institutions and tech community. The workshop is to showcase the work that has 
been done in Pokhara and reflect on expanding the work at regional level.
